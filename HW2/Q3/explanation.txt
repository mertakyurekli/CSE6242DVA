Before choosing nonlinear scales we should determine the skewness of data
Log Scale:
    1. Very large skewness
    2. To show percent change or multiplicative factors.
    3. The relationship between x and y is Logarithmic.
Square Scale:
    1. Large skewness.
    2. The relationship between x and y is quadratic.
